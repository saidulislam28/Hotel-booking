Just for example
I have 4 routes in my navbar
each route have many dropdown options. And each dropdown option is link of a new page.
Can I set Title as a navbar route, path is navigation link for parent route, children is dropdown option and path is navigation link.
[ 
  {
  title: 'Home',
  path: '/',
  children:[
    {
      title: 'dropdown_option_1', 
      path: '/option_1'
    },
    {
      title: 'dropdown_option_2', 
      path: '/option_2'
    },
    {
      title: 'dropdown_option_3', 
      path: '/option_3'
    },
  ]},
  {
  title: 'Rooms',
  path: '/rooms',
  children:[
    {
      title: 'dropdown_option_1', 
      path: '/option_1'
    }
  ]},
]
